## An clean obsidian theme meant to get out of your way

There are so many great Obsidian themes out there but non matched exactly what I was looking for so I did what anyone would do and made my own featuring light and dark modes. Loosely inspired by Apple Notes and Tailwinds default theming.

## Screenshots

## Plugins Used
Some plugs I use to get some of these effects IE the Icons and Code sampling are:

* [Code Block](obsidian://show-plugin?id=code-block-plugin)
* [Iconize](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-icon-folder)

This theme supports you choosing your own fonts and acceent color but if you want to match these screen shots exactly use the following

#### Accent Color

This is my first theme, and if you have suggestions for improvement please let me know and I look forward to learning more.
